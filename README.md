# Todo App
This is a Todo app created using typescript and vite.
### The Project is created as part of my learning `Typescript`
- Here, I used *typescript* for all the logic
- And made **DOM** manipulations to show changes
- `Css` is used for styling


### In the project directory, you need to run:
  
   - `npm install`  To install all the dependencies
   - `npm run dev` Runs the app in the development mode
     
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.
